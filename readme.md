# General summary:
This repository contains code for machine learning. `event.py` is the module that handles fetching events and provides it in a pythonic API. `waveforms.py` fetches waveforms from [IRIS](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/tools/##) and caches then in a local sqlite database in order to accelerate development.
